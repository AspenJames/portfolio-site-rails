Full-stack developer specializing in Ruby, React, and Redux. I enjoy
lightweight applications, databases, and finding new ways to organize and
optimize tasks. My background is in coffee, customer service, and training,
which has helped me cultivate a strong attention to detail and effective
interpersonal skills. My natural curiosity and interest in continuous learning
have driven me in the pursuit of ongoing advancement of my programming
education. In my free time, I enjoy learning new programming languages, finding
(or building) terminal-based alternatives for graphical applications, hiking,
and tinkering with various computer hardware and operating systems.
